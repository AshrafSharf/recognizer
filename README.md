recognizer
==========

A concept for advanced developer tools for dynamic languages.
Ideas will be demostrated on JavaScript, using Brackets editor.

## Does it work already?

Yes (kind of).

1. Open some .js file in Brackets.
2. Reload Brackets, .recognizer.js file will appear (this will be done automatically in future versions).
3. Use this file in &lt;script&gt; loads.
4. Open Live Preview.
5. All function declarations (only these for now) will be instrumented.

- live editing
- inline tests
- code flow visualization
- using tests to define safe patterns of function usage
- code documentation
