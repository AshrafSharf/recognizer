recognizer
==========

A concept for advanced developer tools for dynamic languages.
Ideas will be demostrated on JavaScript, using Brackets editor.

## Does it work already?

Yes (kind of).

1. Open some `.html` file with associated `.js` file in Brackets.
2. `.recognizer.js` file will be created. Use this file as `<script>` source.
3. Open Live Preview.
4. All function declarations (only these for now) will be instrumented.
