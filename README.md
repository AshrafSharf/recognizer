Recognizer
==========

Ideas for advanced developer tools for dynamic languages.

## How to install

### From Brackets (recommended)

Go to Extension Manager in Brackets and look for `recognizer`.

### From source

Clone this repository into Brackets' `?/extensions/user/recognizer/` folder.

## How to use

1. Open a folder in Brackets (a project) with JavaScript files you want to debug.
1. Double-click on the JavaScript files you want to instrument (so that they are in `Working Files`).
1. Open Live Preview. You should now be able to inspect variables in JavaScript files.

If you encounter any problems, more information might be available in the console (Debug -> Show Developer Tools).
