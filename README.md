recognizer
==========

A concept for advanced developer tools for dynamic languages.
Ideas will be demostrated on JavaScript, using Brackets editor.

## How to use

Recognizer is not finished yet. To try it out, here's what you should do:

1. Open a folder in Brackets (a project) with JavaScript files you want to debug.
1. Double-click on the JavaScript files you want to instrument (so that they are in `Working Files`).
1. Open Live Preview. You should now be able to inspect variables in JavaScript files.

If you encounter any problems, more information might be available in the console (Debug -> Show Developer Tools).

## Scope
- automatic debugging, code inspection
- live editing
- inline tests
- code flow visualization
- using tests to define safe patterns of function usage
- code documentation
- semantic highlighting

## TODO
- better object inspection
- semantic highlighting
- code execution animation
- execution timeline
